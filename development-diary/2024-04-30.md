- 23:20:09 Как гигантский поклонник фильма The Social Network(2010) я очень вдохновляюсь сценой логгинга процесса создания веб сервиса Цукербергом в начале фильма.Решил что интересным подходом будет сделать то же самое.Даже если я не пройду на третий этап,то будет по меньшей мере красивая история в маркдаун формате 
- 23:27:56 The diary is going to be written in 3 languages(Eng,Kaz,Rus) if it is comfortable for me.Would be preferable to log everything in english 
- 23:29:01 As I had a pretty hard week in academic performance and had no time to do everything during the week,it's going to feel kinda like a Hackathon,but with only one participant 
- 23:29:17 Let the hacking begin 
- 23:31:13 would be a good idea to divide the project into two folders 
- 23:31:52 I think this project would be a good example of how one can learn nearly anything in no time if he just wants it 
- 23:33:32 As I only had experience with mobile apps and never developed anything big in terms of web (as I had only developed mobile apps in terms of client applications)I'm going to learn react from zero it it's going to be necessary 
- 23:34:39 hope raw html/css will be pretty much enough 
- 23:36:58 I'm going to rely heavily on design of sxodim.com/almaty as it is the closest thing to my task 
- 23:42:09 I already had experience with UI/UX design so working on a layout won't be a problem I suppose.I will give myself 30 minutes to create it  
- 23:45:42

- 23:47:26 I hadn't been coding for a long time.What a shame 
- 23:50:59 I will have a great rest after I will finish it.Thing is this saturday I will have a lesson.What a shame x2
